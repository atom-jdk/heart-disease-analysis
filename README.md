# heart-disease-analysis

predicting heart-disease using machine learning
This notebook looks into using various python-based machine learning and data science libraries in an attempt to build a machne learning model capable ofg predicting wheter or not someone has heart disease based on their medical attributes
W're going to take the following approach:

Problem definition
Data
Evaluation
Features
Modelling
Experimentation
1. Problem Definition
In a Statement,

Given clinical parameters about a patient,can we predict whether or not they have heart disease ?

2. Data
The originl data came from the cleavland data from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.--> https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/45/heart+disease

There is also a version of it available on kaggle--https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/redwankarimsony/heart-disease-data

3. Evaluation
If we reach 95% accuracy at predicting whether or not a patient has heart disease during the proof of concept,we'll pursue the project.

4. Features
This is where you'll get different information about each of the features in your data. You can do this via doing your own research (such as looking at the links above) or by talking to a subject matter expert (someone who knows about the dataset).
